- Language support for tagged unions (similar to Rust)

variant Token {
    Identifier{ name : []u8 },
    Integer{ value : u64 },
    // ...
}

var token : Token = {

- defer statment
var file_handle := open("file.txt");
defer close(file_handle);

- declare procedures inside other procedures.

- Detect when vars are used before initialization (Herb Sutter initialization safety)
  - No need to init to zero in this case.
  - Procedure parameters marked as in (default), out (must be initialized by proc), or inout (anything goes).

- const types by default! (best with in, out, inout proc params as proposed by Herb Sutter)
  let x : int; // Is const once initialized.
  x = 2; // cannot be updated after this

  let x : mut int = 10; // Mutable int
  x = 2;
  x = 4;

- Compile-time execution of **compiled** programs

var book_names : [10][]u8 = #run get_book_names();
